PIL

Quick and easy
Python2: sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-h5py python-pil
Python3: sudo apt-get install python3-scipy python3-h5py python3-pil
but depending on your use-case that may leave you with outdated versions.

For something fancier, e.g. with a Python-Environment you can:
pip install scipy h5py PIL
